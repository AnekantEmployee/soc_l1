## üîç What Happened & Investigation
The incident involved a user attempting to bypass a conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID. The user logged into the system with an incorrect username and password, which was not authorized.

### Investigation Findings:
- **IP Reputation Analysis**: The IP address associated with the user's device had been seen by other users who were also experiencing similar issues.
- **User Verification**: The user provided a list of known clean IPs that matched the user's location. However, no suspicious activity was found in the logs or MFA status.

### Quality Assessment:
- **False Positive Reason**: The IP reputation analysis identified an IP address associated with the user but did not provide any evidence to confirm whether this is a legitimate user or a malicious one.
- **Justification**: This false positive indicates that the user may have been using a clean IP address, which could be due to various reasons such as:
  - A known good IP address
  - An IP address associated with a trusted user
  - A common IP address used by legitimate users

### Simple Investigation Steps (L1 Analyst Guide)

#### Step 1: Initial Review
- **What to check first**: Check the user's device logs for any unusual activity.
- **Where to look for information**: Look at the user's login history and any suspicious activities that occurred during their session.

#### Step 2: Data Collection
- **What logs to check**: The user's device logs, including login attempts, access times, and any other relevant data points.
- **Which users to investigate**: Identify all known good users who were using the same IP address or similar patterns of behavior.

#### Step 3: Analysis & Verification
- **How to verify if threat is real**: Use a tool like KQL (Kusto Query Language) to analyze the user's login data and compare it with known clean IPs.
- **What patterns to look for**: Look for any unusual activity or anomalies in the logs that could indicate a breach.

#### Step 4: Decision Making
- **When to mark as True Positive**: If the IP address is associated with legitimate users who are using clean IPs, this can be considered a False Positive.
- **When to mark as False Positive**: If the user's device logs show no suspicious activity or if the KQL analysis confirms that the user is not using a clean IP address, it can be marked as a True Positive.

#### Step 5: Documentation
- **What to document**: Log all findings and any actions taken during the investigation.
- **How to close the ticket**: Provide clear instructions on how to resolve the incident and update the system accordingly.
