## üë®‚Äçüíª Simple Investigation Steps (L1 Analyst Guide)

**Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:**

### Step 1: Initial Review
* **What to check first:**  The incident number (208307 in this case), the reported time (7/1/2025 13:11), and whether VIP users are involved (Yes, in this case).
* **Where to look for information:** The incident details in the alert itself.
* **What questions to ask:**  Is this a VIP user? What time did the event occur?  What is the incident number?

### Step 2: Data Collection
* **What logs to check:**  Check the audit sign-in logs and location logs for the users involved.
* **Which users to investigate:**  The users mentioned in the incident details.
* **What timeframes to review:** The timeframe around the reported time (7/1/2025 13:11).

### Step 3: Analysis & Verification
* **How to verify if the threat is real:** Check the IP addresses for malicious activity using an IP reputation tool. Review user login locations to see if they match known locations. Examine login attempts for patterns of failure.
* **What patterns to look for:** Unusual login locations, multiple failed login attempts from the same IP, logins outside of normal working hours.
* **How to check IP reputation:** Use a reputable IP reputation database or tool.

### Step 4: Decision Making
* **When to mark as True Positive:** If you find malicious IPs, unusual login locations, or suspicious login patterns.
* **When to mark as False Positive:** If the IPs are clean, locations are expected, and there's no evidence of malicious activity (like in this case).
* **When to escalate to L2/L3:** If you are unsure about the nature of the activity, if VIP users are involved and the activity is suspicious, if multiple users are affected simultaneously, or if you cannot determine true/false positive within the SLA time.

### Step 5: Documentation
* **What to document:** All steps taken during the investigation, findings (IP addresses, locations, user details), and the reason for classifying the alert as a true or false positive.
* **How to close the ticket:** Follow standard procedures for closing tickets in your system.
* **What comments to add:** A clear summary of your investigation and findings, including any actions taken.
