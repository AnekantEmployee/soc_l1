## üîç What Happened & Investigation

### Investigation Findings:
- The user attempted to log into the Microsoft Entra ID account without proper authentication.
- The incident involved multiple users and locations, indicating a potential issue with the conditional access rule.

### Quality Assessment:

**Quality Audit:**
- **False Positive Reason**: The user was attempting to bypass the conditional access rule in an environment where MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled for all users. This suggests that the user may have been using an unverified or compromised IP address.
  
**Justification:**
- **Reasoning**: If a user is trying to log into an account without proper authentication, it's likely because they are attempting to bypass the conditional access rule in the system. The fact that multiple users were involved and the location was US, IN, MX, and MA indicates that this is not a typical scenario where MFA would be enabled.
- **Documentation**: Detailed logs of user activities, including IP addresses, locations, and login times, can help identify potential issues.
