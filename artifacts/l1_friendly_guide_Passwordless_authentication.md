Triaging steps: IP : Clean, Closure comments :Observed events, checked sign in logs of users(obarkhordarian@arcutis.com,jfennewald@arcutis.com,nkolla@arcutis.com), clean IP, using registered devices and known apps nothing suspicious found , closing as a false positive

### Investigation Findings:
The investigation found that the passwordless authentication events were from known users (obarkhordarian@arcutis.com, jfennewald@arcutis.com, nkolla@arcutis.com) using registered devices and applications.  The IP addresses were clean. No suspicious activity was detected.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Simple Investigation Steps (L1 Analyst Guide)

**Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:**

### Step 1: Initial Review
* **What to check first:**  The incident number, date, time, and involved users.  Check if any VIP users are involved.
* **Where to look for information:** The alert details in the ticketing system.
* **What questions to ask:** Are the users legitimate? Are the login locations and devices expected? Is the IP address known and safe?

### Step 2: Data Collection
* **What logs to check:** Check the sign-in logs for the users involved.  (This might involve using a specific KQL query, as mentioned in the procedure steps.)
* **Which users to investigate:** The users listed in the alert details (e.g., obarkhordarian@arcutis.com, jfennewald@arcutis.com, nkolla@arcutis.com).
* **What timeframes to review:** The timeframe around the reported alert time.

### Step 3: Analysis & Verification
* **How to verify if the threat is real:** Check if the users accessed any unusual applications or performed actions outside their normal behavior. Verify the IP addresses used for logins.
* **What patterns to look for:** Unusual login times, locations, or devices.  Multiple login attempts from the same user.
* **How to check IP reputation:** Use a tool like VirusTotal to check the reputation of any involved IP addresses.

### Step 4: Decision Making
* **When to mark as True Positive:** If the passwordless authentication involved unauthorized access to sensitive systems or applications, or if the user's activity is otherwise suspicious (unusual login location, device, time, etc.).
* **When to mark as False Positive:** If the authentication was from a known user, using a registered device and application, from a known safe IP address, and no suspicious activity is observed.
* **When to escalate to L2/L3:** If you are unsure about the legitimacy of the activity, if VIP users are involved, if multiple users are affected, or if you cannot determine true/false positive within the SLA time.

### Step 5: Documentation
* **What to document:** All steps taken during the investigation, findings (including IP reputation checks, user verification, and location analysis), and the final classification (True Positive or False Positive).
* **How to close the ticket:** Follow your organization's standard procedures for closing security alerts.
* **What comments to add:** A clear summary of your investigation, including the reasons for your classification.

‚Ä¢ KQL queries for reviewing sign-in logs.
‚Ä¢ VirusTotal for IP reputation checks.

### üí° Pro Tips:
‚Ä¢ Always check IP reputation first.
‚Ä¢ Look for patterns in login times and locations.
‚Ä¢ VIP users require extra attention.
‚Ä¢ Document everything clearly for future reference.
