üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 002 - Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, "Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID," [Rule ID: 002], triggers when a user attempts to access resources while failing to meet the defined conditional access policies within Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). This could indicate a potential unauthorized access attempt or a legitimate user encountering issues with MFA or other access controls. The alert's severity is classified as "Low," suggesting a lower immediate risk, but it warrants investigation to determine the root cause. The alert leverages Microsoft Entra ID logs to detect discrepancies between attempted access and established conditional access rules. False positives can occur due to legitimate user issues or temporary network problems. True positives often involve malicious actors attempting to circumvent security measures.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1098 (Account Manipulation) https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/ https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/ These techniques represent attempts to use valid credentials (T1078) or manipulate accounts (T1098) to bypass security controls. Specifically, T1098.005 (Account Manipulation: Device Registration) is relevant as attackers might register devices to bypass conditional access.

Common Attack Patterns: Adversaries might attempt to use stolen credentials, compromised accounts, or exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process to bypass conditional access policies. They may also leverage phishing or social engineering to obtain legitimate user credentials.

Threat Actor Tactics: This alert can be used by various threat actors, from script kiddies to advanced persistent threats (APTs). The goal is often to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.

Business Impact: Successful bypasses could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, account compromise, and potential regulatory non-compliance.

Technical Details:

Data Sources: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs, sign-in logs.

Detection Logic: The rule monitors Microsoft Entra ID logs for sign-in attempts that fail to meet the configured conditional access policies. It flags events where access is denied due to policy violations.

False Positive Causes: Legitimate users experiencing temporary network issues, MFA failures due to device problems, incorrect passwords, or policy misconfigurations.

True Positive Indicators: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, suspicious user activity preceding the alert, attempts to access sensitive resources, correlation with other security alerts indicating a potential breach.

üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions:

Check the alert severity (Low in this case). Note the SLA timer if applicable.
Identify the affected user(s) from the alert details.
Check if any VIP users are involved (the JSON indicates VIP users were involved in the historical incident).
Review basic context: timestamp, source IP address, and frequency of similar alerts.
Quick Validation:

Is this a known false positive pattern? (The historical incident was a false positive).
Are there multiple similar alerts occurring simultaneously?
Is this alert part of a larger security event or campaign?
Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis:

Examine Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs for the affected user(s) around the alert timestamp.
Focus on the Conditional Access Status field to understand why access was denied.
Check for error codes (e.g., 70043 as mentioned in search results) and their descriptions.
Review audit logs for any unusual activity related to the user account or device.
Context Gathering:

Gather user account information (location, device details, roles).
Obtain system/application details accessed during the attempt.
Collect network information (source IP address, geolocation).
Look for related security events (e.g., suspicious logins from other locations).
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation:

Verify the user's location and device at the time of the login attempt.
Check the IP address reputation using online tools.
Analyze the user's recent activity for any anomalies.
Investigate if the user reported any issues with access.
Pattern Analysis:

Compare the current incident with similar historical incidents (the JSON provides one example).
Look for patterns in the timing, location, or user accounts involved.
Cross-reference with known threat intelligence to identify potential malicious actors or attack patterns.
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, suspicious user activity, attempts to access sensitive resources, correlation with other security alerts.

False Positive Criteria: Legitimate user experiencing temporary network issues, MFA failures due to device problems, incorrect passwords, or policy misconfigurations. A single isolated incident with a clean IP address and no other suspicious activity.

Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2/L3 if multiple failed login attempts are observed from suspicious locations, if VIP accounts are involved, or if the incident correlates with other security events suggesting a potential breach. Escalate immediately if a data breach is suspected.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, findings, and remediation actions in the incident ticket. Preserve relevant logs and evidence. Note any lessons learned.

Closure Process: Close the ticket after confirming the incident's classification (true positive or false positive) and completing all necessary remediation actions. Follow up with the user if necessary.

üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 014 - User Assigned Privileged Role
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert triggers when a user is assigned a privileged role within the organization's systems. This could indicate legitimate administrative actions, but also potentially unauthorized privilege escalation or malicious activity. The alert aims to identify instances where a user gains access to sensitive functionalities they shouldn't have, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromises, or other security incidents. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the assigned role and the circumstances surrounding the assignment. A Global Administrator role assignment, for example, would be considered far more critical than assigning a role with limited permissions.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, T1078: Valid Accounts, T1098.002: Account Manipulation (Privilege Escalation)

T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges. In this case, the alert might detect an attacker exploiting a vulnerability to gain the ability to assign privileged roles.
T1078: Valid Accounts: Attackers often leverage legitimate accounts to blend in with normal activity. This alert could highlight an attacker using a compromised account to assign themselves or another account privileged access.
T1098.002: Account Manipulation (Privilege Escalation): This technique focuses on directly manipulating account settings to gain higher privileges. This alert directly addresses this by detecting the assignment of privileged roles.
Common Attack Patterns: Attackers might compromise an existing account with administrative privileges or exploit vulnerabilities in the system responsible for role assignments. They could then use this elevated access to perform lateral movement within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware.

Threat Actor Tactics: This technique is used by various threat actors, from financially motivated attackers to advanced persistent threats (APTs). The goal is often to gain persistent access to systems and data, enabling further malicious activities.

Business Impact: Unauthorized privilege escalation can lead to data breaches, system disruptions, financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory non-compliance.

Technical Details:

Data Sources: This alert likely relies on logs from the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, specifically logs recording role assignments and changes to user permissions. It may also correlate with other security logs, such as authentication logs and system activity logs.

Detection Logic: The rule monitors role assignments and flags assignments that meet specific criteria, such as assignments to high-privilege roles, assignments outside of normal business hours, or assignments from unusual IP addresses or locations.

False Positive Causes: Legitimate administrative actions, such as onboarding new employees, granting temporary access for maintenance, or routine permission changes, can trigger this alert. System errors or misconfigurations can also lead to false positives.

True Positive Indicators: Assignments to high-privilege roles from compromised accounts, unusual IP addresses, or outside of normal business hours; multiple privileged role assignments in quick succession; assignments to dormant accounts that have been recently reactivated.

üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions:

Check alert severity. (High severity if a critical role is involved)
Identify the affected user.
Note the time of the assignment.
Check if the affected user is a VIP.
Review the source IP address and location.
Quick Validation:

Is this a known false positive pattern (e.g., routine administrative task)?
Are there multiple similar alerts indicating a potential attack campaign?
Does the affected user have a history of security incidents?
Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis:

Examine IAM logs for the specific role assignment event. Focus on timestamps, user details, assigning user, source IP, and any additional context provided.
Review authentication logs for the affected user around the time of the role assignment. Look for unusual login attempts or locations.
Check system activity logs for any suspicious actions performed by the affected user after the role assignment.
Context Gathering:

Gather user account information (creation date, last password change, MFA status).
Obtain details about the assigned privileged role (permissions, sensitivity).
Identify the system or application where the role was assigned.
Determine the source IP address's reputation and geolocation.
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation:

Verify the legitimacy of the role assignment. Was it authorized? Was it part of a known process?
Investigate the assigning user's account for any signs of compromise.
Analyze the source IP address for malicious activity. Use threat intelligence feeds to check its reputation.
Pattern Analysis:

Search for similar historical incidents involving the same user, role, or IP address.
Look for patterns of escalating privileges or lateral movement.
Compare the user's activity before and after the role assignment to establish a baseline.
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Unauthorized role assignment to a high-privilege account, especially from a compromised account or suspicious IP address; unusual activity following the assignment; evidence of malicious intent.

False Positive Criteria: Legitimate administrative action, such as onboarding a new employee or granting temporary access; assignment from a known and trusted IP address; no unusual activity following the assignment.

Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2/L3 if the assignment is unauthorized, involves a high-privilege role, originates from a suspicious source, or is part of a larger attack campaign. Escalate immediately if there's evidence of data exfiltration or system compromise.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, findings, and remediation actions taken. Include screenshots, log excerpts, and threat intelligence reports.

Closure Process: Close the ticket once the incident is fully investigated and remediated. Document lessons learned and any necessary security improvements.
