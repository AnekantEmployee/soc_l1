üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 002 - Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, "Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID" (Rule ID: 002), signifies a potential security event where a user or system attempted to access resources in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) without fulfilling the defined conditional access policies. This could indicate a legitimate user encountering issues, a compromised account, or a sophisticated attack attempting to circumvent security controls. The alert's low severity suggests a high likelihood of false positives, requiring careful investigation. https://analyticsrules.exchange/analyticrules/3af9285d-bb98-4a35-ad29-5ea39ba0c628/

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1098 (Account Manipulation). T1098.005 (Account Manipulation: Device Registration) is a relevant sub-technique if the bypass attempt involved registering a new device. https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/ https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005/

Common Attack Patterns: Adversaries might attempt to bypass conditional access rules using stolen credentials, compromised accounts, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process. They may also leverage phishing or social engineering to obtain legitimate user credentials.

Threat Actor Tactics: This technique is used by various threat actors, from script kiddies to advanced persistent threats (APTs), to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.

Business Impact: Successful bypass could lead to data breaches, account compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive systems, and potential regulatory non-compliance.

Technical Details:

Data Sources: Microsoft Entra ID logs, potentially including audit logs and sign-in logs. The specific data source is identified as "AD" in the provided context.

Detection Logic: The rule monitors Microsoft Entra ID activity for attempts to access resources that violate established conditional access policies. It likely flags events where authentication succeeded despite not meeting the specified conditions (e.g., MFA failure, location restrictions).

False Positive Causes: Legitimate users might trigger this alert due to network connectivity issues, MFA failures (e.g., due to timeouts or device problems), or temporary issues with conditional access policies. Incorrectly configured policies can also lead to a high false positive rate.

True Positive Indicators: Multiple failed attempts to bypass conditional access, unusual login locations, suspicious user activity (e.g., unusual access times or patterns), and correlation with other security events (e.g., malware infections or phishing attempts).

Quality Assessment:

Quality Audit: Pass
Classification Reasoning: Legitimate user
Justification: Workspace not working
üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions:

Check the alert severity (Low in this case). Note the SLA timer (not breached here).
Identify affected users (multiple users mentioned).
Check for VIP user involvement (Yes, in this case).
Review basic context (time, location, frequency - single incident).
Quick Validation:

Is this a known false positive pattern? (Potentially, given the historical data).
Are there multiple similar alerts? (No, based on the context).
Is this part of a larger campaign? (No evidence provided).
Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis:

Review Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs for the affected users around the reported timestamp.
Examine audit logs for any unusual activity related to the users or their accounts.
Focus on Conditional Access related logs to understand which policies were triggered and their results.
Context Gathering:

Gather user account information (location, device details, roles).
Obtain details of the accessed resources.
Collect network information (IP addresses, geolocation).
Check for related security events (e.g., malware alerts, phishing attempts).
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation:

Verify the IP addresses involved using reputation services.
Analyze user login patterns for anomalies.
Check if the user's location matches their usual login locations.
Investigate if the failed attempts were due to MFA issues or policy misconfigurations.
Pattern Analysis:

Compare the incident with similar historical incidents (see Historical Context section).
Look for any patterns or trends in the data.
Cross-reference with threat intelligence feeds for known malicious IPs or attack patterns.
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, suspicious user activity, correlation with other security events, and evidence of malicious intent.

False Positive Criteria: Single failed login attempt from a known location, legitimate user experiencing technical difficulties, MFA failures due to user error or technical issues, and no other suspicious activity.

Escalation Triggers: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, suspicious user activity, correlation with other security events, and evidence of malicious intent. Escalate to L2 if the investigation cannot determine the root cause within a reasonable timeframe.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, evidence collected, and the final classification (True Positive/False Positive). Include justification for the classification.

Closure Process: Close the ticket after documenting the findings and remediation steps. Ensure all relevant stakeholders are informed of the outcome. Follow-up actions might include policy adjustments or user training.

Details: Attempt to bypass conditional access rule; legitimate user experiencing workspace issues.
Resolution: Classified as a false positive after investigation.
Lessons Learned: Need to improve workspace stability to reduce false positives.
üö® Remediation & Escalation Procedures
Immediate Remediation Steps
For True Positives:

Immediately block the suspicious IP address(es).
Reset the compromised user account password.
Enable MFA for the affected account (if not already enabled).
Investigate for malware infection on the affected system(s).
Notify the user about the security incident.
For False Positives:

No immediate remediation is required in this case, as the incident was determined to be a false positive due to workspace issues. The focus should be on resolving the underlying workspace problem.
Escalation Matrix
L1 to L2 Escalation Triggers: Multiple similar alerts within a short timeframe, evidence of a sophisticated attack, inability to determine the root cause after initial investigation, or involvement of critical systems/data.

L2 to L3 Escalation Triggers: Large-scale security incident, significant data breach, or involvement of senior management.

Emergency Escalation Procedures
Immediate Escalation Required When: Evidence of active data exfiltration, widespread account compromise, critical system compromise, or regulatory compliance violation.

Emergency Contact Information: [Insert SOC Manager contact details, CISO notification procedures, etc.]

Containment & Recovery Actions
Short-term Containment (0-4 hours): Isolate affected accounts or systems if necessary.

Long-term Recovery (4-24 hours): Resolve the underlying workspace issue that caused the false positive. Implement preventative measures to reduce future false positives (e.g., improve network stability, refine conditional access policies).

‚ö° Actions Taken & Results
Triaging Steps Performed: IP address verification, review of user logs, and confirmation of guest MFA enabled status.

Technical Analysis: IP reputation was clean. User account verification showed no malicious activity. Geographic analysis showed logins from US, IN, MX, and MA. No device or authentication analysis details are provided.

Escalation Actions: None.

Final Resolution: The incident was classified as a false positive due to workspace issues.
