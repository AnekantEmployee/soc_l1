üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 002 - Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, triggered by rule 002, signals a potential attempt to circumvent Microsoft Entra ID's (formerly Azure Active Directory) conditional access rules. Conditional access rules are security policies that control access to resources based on various factors like user location, device type, and authentication methods. A bypass attempt could indicate malicious activity aiming to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. The business impact could range from minor inconvenience (e.g., a legitimate user temporarily locked out) to a significant security breach (e.g., unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems). The severity is currently classified as Low, but this should be reassessed based on the investigation findings. The alert is designed to detect unusual or suspicious login attempts that fail to meet the defined conditional access policies.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1098 (Account Manipulation) These techniques are commonly used by attackers to gain initial access and maintain persistence within a target environment. Specifically, T1098.005 (Account Manipulation: Device Registration) is relevant if the bypass attempt involves registering a compromised device.

Common Attack Patterns: Attackers might attempt to bypass conditional access rules by using stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process, or using compromised devices. They may also target users with weak passwords or those lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Threat Actor Tactics: This alert could be triggered by various threat actors, from script kiddies to advanced persistent threats (APTs). The specific tactics employed would depend on the attacker's goals and capabilities.

Business Impact: Successful bypass attempts could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, account compromise, and disruption of business operations.

Technical Details:

Data Sources: This alert leverages logs from Microsoft Entra ID, specifically Sign-in logs and potentially AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs.

Detection Logic: The rule identifies login attempts where the ConditionalAccessStatus is 1 (indicating a bypass attempt or failure to meet conditional access requirements). It analyzes various factors associated with the login attempt to determine if it warrants further investigation.

False Positive Causes: Legitimate users might trigger this alert due to temporary network issues, incorrect password entries, or problems with MFA. Changes to conditional access policies themselves can also trigger false positives. The rule may need adjustments to reduce false positives based on the environment's specific configuration.

True Positive Indicators: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, use of compromised credentials, suspicious device registration, and correlation with other security alerts are strong indicators of a genuine threat.

üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions: Check the alert severity (currently Low), note the time of the alert, identify the affected user(s), check if any VIP users are involved (Yes in this case), and review the basic context (time, location, frequency).

Quick Validation: Check if this is a known false positive pattern (based on historical data, this alert has a high false positive rate). Are there multiple similar alerts occurring simultaneously? Does this seem to be part of a larger attack campaign?

Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis: Examine Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs for the affected user(s) around the alert timestamp. Focus on the ConditionalAccessStatus, location details, device information, and IP addresses.

Context Gathering: Gather user account information (permissions, roles), system/application details accessed, network information (IP addresses, geolocation), and any related security events.

Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation: Verify the user's location against known trusted locations. Check the IP address reputation using external threat intelligence feeds. Analyze the user's login history for unusual patterns.

Pattern Analysis: Compare this incident to similar historical incidents. Look for any indicators of attack progression (e.g., escalation of privileges). Cross-reference findings with known threat patterns.

Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Multiple failed login attempts from untrusted locations, suspicious device usage, correlation with other security alerts, and evidence of credential compromise.

False Positive Criteria: Single failed login attempt from a trusted location, user reporting technical difficulties, known network issues, or recent changes to conditional access policies.

Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2/L3 if multiple accounts are affected, VIP users are involved, or if there's evidence of a sophisticated attack. Include all collected data in the escalation report.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, findings, and remediation actions in the incident ticket. Preserve relevant logs and evidence. Capture lessons learned for future improvements.

Closure Process: Properly close the ticket after remediation and verification. Follow up with the affected user(s) if necessary. Communicate the resolution to relevant stakeholders.

Passwordless authentication analysis

üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 183 - Detect passwordless authentication
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, "Detect passwordless authentication" (Rule ID 183), triggers when a user successfully authenticates to a system or application without using a password, leveraging methods like biometric authentication, security keys, or mobile authenticator apps. While passwordless authentication enhances security by eliminating password-related vulnerabilities, this alert aims to identify potentially unauthorized or suspicious passwordless logins. The business impact of a false positive is user inconvenience and potential disruption to workflow. A true positive, however, indicates a potential compromise of user accounts or systems, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential financial or reputational damage. The alert prioritizes identifying instances where passwordless logins deviate from established user behavior or originate from unusual locations or devices.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: While a specific MITRE ATT&CK technique isn't directly mapped to a successful passwordless authentication, the underlying vulnerabilities exploited to gain unauthorized access before the passwordless login could map to several techniques. For example, if an attacker compromises credentials beforehand, it could relate to T1078 (Valid Accounts) or T1552 (Unsecured Credentials). If the attacker uses phishing or other social engineering to trick the user into approving a login, it could relate to T1566 (Phishing). The successful authentication itself isn't inherently malicious, but the preceding actions might be.

Common Attack Patterns: Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in the passwordless authentication system itself (zero-day exploits), or they might leverage compromised credentials or social engineering (phishing, MFA fatigue) to gain access.

Threat Actor Tactics: Threat actors utilize various tactics to exploit passwordless authentication, including credential stuffing, phishing attacks targeting users' authenticator apps, and exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying authentication infrastructure.

Business Impact: Unauthorized access to systems and data, data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory fines (depending on the industry and data involved).

Technical Details:

Data Sources: Active Directory (AD) logs.

Detection Logic: The rule monitors AD login events and flags instances where a user successfully authenticates without providing a password. The specific criteria for flagging are not provided in the available documentation.

False Positive Causes: Legitimate use of passwordless authentication methods by authorized users. This is the most common cause based on historical data. Unusual login times or locations for legitimate users might also trigger false positives.

True Positive Indicators: Passwordless logins from unfamiliar devices or locations, logins outside of normal working hours, multiple failed login attempts preceding a successful passwordless login, and logins associated with compromised accounts.

üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions: Check alert severity (Medium), note the timestamp, identify the affected user(s), and check if any VIP users are involved. Review basic context (time, location, frequency of similar alerts).
Quick Validation: Check if this is a known false positive pattern (legitimate user). Are there multiple similar alerts for the same user or from the same IP address? Does this seem part of a larger campaign?
Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis: Examine AD login logs for the affected user(s) around the alert timestamp. Focus on the authentication method used, device information, IP address, and location.
Context Gathering: Gather user account information (permissions, roles), system/application details accessed, network information (IP addresses, geolocation), and related security events (if any).
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation: Verify if the passwordless authentication method used was legitimate (e.g., registered device, expected location). Cross-reference the user's typical login patterns and device usage.
Pattern Analysis: Check for similar historical incidents involving the same user or IP address. Look for any unusual activity patterns (e.g., multiple login attempts from different locations).
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Passwordless login from an unregistered device, unusual location, outside normal working hours, preceded by failed login attempts, or associated with known compromised accounts.
False Positive Criteria: Legitimate user using a registered device and expected location during normal working hours.
Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2/L3 if the incident involves VIP users, multiple compromised accounts, or if the investigation reveals signs of a broader attack.
Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, findings, and remediation actions in the incident ticket. Preserve relevant logs and evidence. Note any lessons learned.
Closure Process: Close the ticket after completing the investigation and remediation. Follow up with the user if necessary.
