üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 002 - Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, "Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID," triggers when a user attempts to access resources in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) but fails to meet the conditions set by a configured conditional access policy. This could indicate a legitimate user encountering issues (e.g., network problems, device incompatibility), or a malicious actor attempting to circumvent security controls. The alert itself doesn't directly identify malicious activity; further investigation is crucial to determine its nature. The alert relies on logs generated by Microsoft Entra ID's authentication and authorization processes. False positives are common and often stem from legitimate user issues with MFA or network connectivity. True positives, however, represent potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1098 (Account Manipulation). Specifically, attempts to bypass conditional access often involve techniques like credential stuffing (T1110) or exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process (T1550.002).

Common Attack Patterns: Attackers might try to bypass conditional access policies by using stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication system, or using compromised devices. They may also attempt to use brute-force attacks to guess passwords or use phishing techniques to obtain user credentials.

Threat Actor Tactics: This alert can be relevant to various threat actors, from financially motivated attackers targeting sensitive data to nation-state actors seeking to compromise organizational systems. The specific tactics employed will depend on the attacker's goals and resources.

Business Impact: A successful bypass could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, data breaches, and reputational damage. The impact depends on the sensitivity of the accessed resources and the attacker's actions.

Technical Details:

Data Sources: Microsoft Entra ID authentication logs, conditional access logs.

Detection Logic: The rule monitors Microsoft Entra ID logs for authentication attempts that fail to satisfy the configured conditional access policies. It flags events where a user's access request is denied due to policy violations.

False Positive Causes: Network connectivity issues, MFA failures due to device or application problems, legitimate users encountering temporary access problems, incorrect configuration of conditional access policies.

True Positive Indicators: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, logins from compromised devices, suspicious user activity after a successful bypass, attempts to access sensitive resources after a policy failure.

Investigation Findings
Resolver Comments: "Triaging steps: IP : Clean, Closure comments : Observed the events , checked the logs for the users , all failed attempts were seen , known clean IPs were seen. location US,IN,MX & MA, guest MFA enabled for users nothing suspicious found."

Triaging Steps: None explicitly listed in the provided data.

Evidence Collected:

IP Analysis: IPs were determined to be clean and from known locations (US, IN, MX, MA).
User Analysis: Multiple users were involved; no suspicious activity was detected. Guest MFA was enabled for the users.
System Analysis: No specific systems were identified as compromised.
Timeline Analysis: All failed attempts were observed within a short timeframe, suggesting a possible temporary issue rather than a sustained attack.
Quality Assessment:

Quality Audit: Pass
Classification Reasoning: Legitimate user; workspace was not working.
Justification: Workspace not working.
üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)
Immediate Actions:

Check the alert severity (Low in this case). Note the SLA timer (already resolved in this instance).
Identify affected users/systems (multiple users, no specific systems identified).
Check for VIP user involvement (Yes, in this case).
Review basic context (time, location, frequency) ‚Äì the alert occurred during the morning shift, involved multiple users, and multiple failed login attempts were observed from known locations.
Quick Validation:

Is this a known false positive pattern? Yes, based on the resolution.
Are there multiple similar alerts? The provided data doesn't indicate this.
Is this part of a larger campaign? The evidence suggests not.
Step 2: Data Collection (Next 10 minutes)
Log Analysis:

Check Microsoft Entra ID authentication logs for the affected users around the reported timestamp.
Examine the Conditional Access logs to see which policies were triggered and why they failed.
Focus on the user's IP addresses, locations, and the specific error codes.
Context Gathering:

Gather user account information (location, device details, MFA status).
Obtain details about the systems or applications the users were trying to access.
Collect network information (IPs, locations) associated with the login attempts.
Review related security events (if any) around the same timeframe.
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (Next 15 minutes)
Threat Validation:

Verify the IP addresses' reputation using threat intelligence feeds.
Check if the users' devices are known to be compromised.
Analyze the conditional access policy failures to understand the reasons for denial.
Look for patterns in the failed login attempts (e.g., brute-force attempts).
Pattern Analysis:

Check for similar historical incidents (see Historical Context section below).
Look for indicators of attack progression (e.g., escalation of privileges).
Verify against known threat patterns using threat intelligence platforms.
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification
True Positive Criteria: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, logins from compromised devices, suspicious user activity after a successful bypass, attempts to access sensitive resources after a policy failure.

False Positive Criteria: Temporary network issues, MFA failures due to device or application problems, legitimate users encountering temporary access problems, incorrect configuration of conditional access policies.

Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2 if: multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations are observed, compromised devices are involved, or there's evidence of a broader attack.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, evidence collected, and the reasoning behind the classification (false positive in this case). Include screenshots of relevant logs and analysis results.

Closure Process: Close the ticket after documenting the findings and ensuring all relevant information is recorded. If a false positive, document the root cause (e.g., network issue, user error).
