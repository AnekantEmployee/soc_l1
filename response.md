Rule 2

üõ°Ô∏è Alert: 002 - Attempt to bypass conditional access rule in Microsoft Entra ID
üìñ Detailed Alert Description & Context
Alert Overview:

This alert, triggered by rule 002, signals a potential attempt to bypass a conditional access rule within Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) are security measures that control access to resources based on various conditions like user location, device type, and authentication methods. Bypassing these rules could indicate malicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. The alert's low severity suggests that while a bypass attempt was detected, it may not have resulted in a successful compromise. However, investigation is crucial to determine if the event was legitimate or malicious. A successful bypass could lead to data breaches, account compromises, and disruption of business operations.

Attack Vector & Techniques:

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1098 (Account Manipulation), T1556 (Modify Authentication Process), T1556.009 (Conditional Access Policies). These techniques suggest an attacker might be leveraging legitimate user accounts or manipulating authentication processes to circumvent security controls.

Common Attack Patterns: Attackers might try to exploit vulnerabilities in the conditional access configuration, use stolen credentials, or employ phishing techniques to trick users into granting access. They may also attempt to leverage compromised devices or accounts to bypass MFA requirements.

Threat Actor Tactics: This alert could be part of a larger campaign involving credential theft, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The attacker's goal might be to gain persistent access to the organization's resources.

Business Impact: A successful bypass could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, reputational damage, and potential financial losses.

Technical Details:

The rule detects attempts to bypass conditional access rules by analyzing Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs. It specifically looks for instances where ConditionalAccessStatus indicates a failure or an attempt to bypass the policy. The data sources include Azure Active Directory SigninLogs and AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs. False positives can occur due to legitimate user actions, such as users accessing resources from untrusted locations or experiencing temporary network issues. True positives are indicated by suspicious login attempts from unusual locations, devices, or times, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.

üë®‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Investigation Analysis
Follow these steps in order when you get a similar alert:

Step 1: Initial Triage (5 mins)
Immediate Actions:

Check alert severity (Low) and SLA timer. This incident has already been resolved.
Identify affected users/systems (Multiple users, locations: US, IN, MX, MA).
Check for VIP user involvement (Yes).
Review basic context (time: 07-01-2025 13:11, frequency: Not provided).
Quick Validation:

Is this a known false positive pattern? Yes, based on historical data.
Are there multiple similar alerts? Not provided.
Is this part of a larger campaign? Not provided.
Step 2: Data Collection (10 mins)
Log Analysis:

Check Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs for the affected users around the reported timestamp.
Examine the ConditionalAccessStatus, Location, Device, and ClientApp fields.
Focus on the time range of 07-01-2025 13:11.
Context Gathering:

Gather user account information (including permissions and roles).
Obtain system/application details accessed during the attempted bypass.
Collect network information (IPs, locations) associated with the login attempts.
Review related security events (if any) around the same timeframe.
Step 3: Analysis & Verification (15 mins)
Threat Validation:

Verify if the reported IP addresses are known malicious or compromised.
Analyze user location and device information to determine if they are legitimate.
Investigate if the user had any unusual activity before or after the attempted bypass.
Use tools like VirusTotal to check IP reputation.
Pattern Analysis:

Check for similar historical incidents (one similar incident found).
Look for attack progression indicators (none detected in this case).
Verify against known threat patterns (no known patterns detected).
Step 4: Decision Making & Classification (5 mins)
True Positive Criteria: Multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations, use of compromised credentials, evidence of malicious activity.

False Positive Criteria: Legitimate user accessing resources from an untrusted location, temporary network issues, or misconfigured conditional access policies.

Escalation Triggers: Escalate to L2/L3 if multiple failed login attempts are observed from the same IP address, if compromised credentials are suspected, or if the affected user has high-level privileges.

Step 5: Documentation & Closure (10 mins)
Required Documentation: Document all investigation steps, findings, and remediation actions in the incident ticket. Preserve relevant logs and screenshots as evidence. Capture lessons learned.

Closure Process: Properly close the ticket after confirming the incident is resolved. Follow up with the user (if necessary) to address any underlying issues. Communicate the resolution to relevant stakeholders.
